== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `moduleAdd m/CS2103T`.

.Component interactions for `moduleAdd m/CS2103T` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="790"]


*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CalendarListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Part of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Module Search

image::SearchCommandUMLDiagram.png[width="790"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/searcher/Search.java[`Search.java`]

Module Search function returns `module` object that contains useful information for each module for the rest of the application to use.
The function first checks if the information is available in local cache, and if it isnt, pulls it from NUSmods API.
The JSON object pulled from the web is then parsed into a `module` object.
This implementation means that a local cache of the added modules will be available even if the user is offline.



=== Profile (Module Book) feature

This profile feature allows users to manage the modules they have taken before or is taking now in NUS.
In details, users are able to store their module taken into the program with the grades for each module stated if applicable and
can also store tasks which are related to each module.

==== Implementation
- This feature is implemented using a panel on the main screen of profile tab with a list of modules that is updated with every command that
may affect module list (such as add, delete or grade).

- The module book (profile) currently supports following features.

. Adds in or deletes modules and display the list of modules in profile tab.
. Updates user's grades for each module and get CAP calculated immediately.
. Manage the tasks related to each module (module tasks) through CLI.
. Any modification to module tasks will be updated in the Calendar tab and also show messages on the result display above CLI.

.Class diagram of structure and relations of NusModule, ModuleBook and relevant classes.
image::NusModuleClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

- As shown in the class diagram above, modules are created by a class called `NusModule`. Every instance of `NusModule` contains a `ModuleCode` object, a
`Grade` object (optional) and a list of `ModuleTask` objects.

[NOTE]
The module book only accept modules that are provided in NUS and will check the module code the user want to add is valid or not by using the search feature mentioned above.

- All possible actions mentioned above such as creating modules, deleting modules and adding tasks to modules are implemented through
the `ModuleBook` class.

- The program will automatically save any modification to module book after each command is executed by calling the `saveModuleBook` method
in `Storage`.

- For example, modules are created with `moduleAdd` command, followed by the module code and grade. (if applicable) +
Our program will check if the module code is valid by using the search feature above and whether the module has already been added in our module book.
And then call method `addModule` in `ModuleBook` to create the module as required. Finally, it will automatically save the module added just now.

- The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user want to add a module in our program.

.Sequence diagram when moduleAdd command is executed
image::ModuleAddSequenceDiagram.png[width="950"]

.Relation between ModuleBook and Task
image::PartOfModelClassDiagramForProfile.png[width="400"]

- The program will synchronize the modification to module tasks in `ModuleBook` with that shown in Calendar tab through `ModelManager` as shown above.
i.e. Any modification in module tasks will be updated in `Task` which is the main class Calendar feature depends on. (see more details in Calendar feature)

==== Example Use Scenario



==== Design Considerations

*Aspect 1*: How the user add in a module into module book for future management ?

- *Current solution*: Only need to provide the module code to add module and it will fetch the information about the module using Module Search feature automatically.
* *Pros*: Users don't need to provide any other information (such as modular credit of the module) for other functionality such as calculating the CAP.
* *Pros*: The module information will be cached locally after you add the module once and this can used for future development.
* *Cons*: Need Internet connection when you add in certain module for the first time.
* *Cons*: Highly depends on the Module Search feature.

- *Alternative Solution*: Let the user enter all information required for each module when they add it in. (such as modular credit)
* *Pros*: More flexible, not depends on other features.
* *Cons*: Very tedious for users to add in lots of modules.
* *Cons*: Need to ask user to provide new information when more new functionality is added in the future.

*Reason for chosen implementation*: +
The current implementation is much more user friendly and have more potential for future development. The implement can become
very ideal if the Module Search feature works properly.

*Aspect 2*: How the user manage their tasks for each module?

- *Current solution*: For each module added, it contains a list of `ModuleTask`. Also update the calendar when add task in.
* *Pros*: Users can either view their tasks for each module separately or view all the tasks shown in Calendar tab.
* *Pros*: More nice-looking that the user can view all the deadlines on calendar.
* *Cons*: Prone to bugs during the synchronization of module book and calendar.

- *Alternative solution*: Only store the list of `ModuleTask` in module book and do not update in Calendar tab.
* *Pros*: Easier to implement and can avoid some synchronization bugs.
* *Cons*: Users can not gain a view of the whole pictures with all tasks shown on calendar.

*Reason for chosen implementation*: +
The current implementation updates the module tasks added in onto the calender and provides the users different ways
to manage their tasks. (as a whole or separately for each module)

=== Calendar Feature

==== Implementation

The calendar feature allows users to add either a `deadline` or a `Module Task` to the calendar.

The implementation of the main calender is facilitated by the CalenderMainPanel class, which serves as the main container for this feature.



=== Notes Feature

==== Implementation

The notes feature allow users to access their desktop files and folders with commands.

This feature is implemented using a panel on the main window, listing out a list of documents and folders that are in the specified directory.

Notes features includes `notesOpen`, `notesCreate`, `notesDelete` and `notesList`.

.Notes List Activity Diagram
image::NotesList.png[width="600"]

.Notes Open Activity Diagram
image::NotesCreation.png[width="600"]

notesCreate and notesDelete activity diagram works similar to notesOpen.


==== Pathing
The Path interface in java allows for 2 implementation of pathing namely:

   1. AbsolutePath
   2. RelativePath

.Notes Pathing Diagram
image::absVSrel.png[width="600"]

AbsolutePath will take the path given from `usr/`.

RelativePath will take reference from the path that the current system has opened, in this case, `usr/Desktop/NUS Y2S2`.
The user is given the freedom to provide any of the 2 forms when using the `notesOpen`, `notesCreate`, `notesDelete` and `notesList` commands.

**AbsolutePath**:

*Benefits*:

This allows for more flexibility as the user do not need to keep note of its current directory and will be able to access any folder/document that is on their system

*cons*:

Will require much more input from the user, for example, referring to the above figure,
Accessing the CS2103T file requires the user to input `loc/Desktop/NUS Y2S2/CS2103T` as opposed to `loc/CS2103T` if the user is using absolute over relative pathing

**RelativePath**:

*Benefits*:

Easier for the user to navigate through the current folder and not key in the whole folder path

*Cons*:

Not as flexible. Referring to the above diagram,
Accessing the *Documents* folder will require the user to input `loc/../../Documents`, this may not be as intuitive to people with no programming background.
Using `loc/Documents abs/abs` will allow the user to access any folder from anywhere.


=== Diary
- `diaryAdd` and `diaryLog` extends from `Command` class
- `DiaryEntry` is another model which contains:
* Diary Entry
* Date
* Weather
* Mood

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
