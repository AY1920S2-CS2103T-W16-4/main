== Introduction



=== An Introduction to NUSProductivity User guide

- NUSProductivity is an application designed for all NUS students to better manage their school work. The app is set out to enhance your productivity in school through 5 main features, module planning, CAP (cumulative average point) tracking, note taking, deadline and task listing, and finally, diary logging. This app is designed only for NUS students for now with the possibility to customise it for students from other universities in the future. More importantly, NUSProductivity is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Read on to get you started on using the application!

- The purpose of this document is for you to familiarise yourself with the functions and capabilities of what NUSProductivity can do.

- The image below shows the different parts of the user interface of NUSProductivity

`deadline` allows you to input a deadline event into the calendar without any specified modules attached to it.

==== Priority Levels

We give you the flexibility to choose and indicate what priority each `moduleTask` should have. This priority is represented from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest priority and 5 being the highest.
